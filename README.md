Two-dimensional (2D) vector graphics is an essential tool for many documenting and computer
graphics applications. In this project, you will explore two portable vector graphics file formats EPS and
SVG. You will write a C library that can generate vector graphics in EPS and SVG or convert between
these two formats. Your library will handle only a subset of functionalities possible with EPS and SVG.


EPS: See https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/5002.PDF for a specification of EPS format.

SVG: See https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp for an introduction to SVG format.
